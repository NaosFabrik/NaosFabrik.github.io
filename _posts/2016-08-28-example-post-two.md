  The History of the Alembic tool
---

Since I was around 10 years old, I started to take pictures.

In my junior and senior high schools, I belonged to a new-founded photo club and worked as a leader in my secound grade in the high school.

I have recieved around both nation wide and international 20 awards. In addition to challenge conpetitions, I also like to take pictures with some message to think about. 

Watching exhibited my works at museums, station, at times, on magazines are precious time, but simultaneously I feel a bit anxitious about how my work reached to visitors and viewers.
