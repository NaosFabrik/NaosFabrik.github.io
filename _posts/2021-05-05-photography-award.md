Since I was around 10 years old, I started to take pictures.

In my junior and senior high schools, I belonged to a new-founded photo club and worked as a leader in my secound grade in the high school.

I have recieved around both nation-wide and international 20 awards. 

Some of them were exhibited in several museums, spreaded as a postcard, used for advertisement, and contributed for the suggestion of filming locations.
